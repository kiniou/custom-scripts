= Install FusionInventory from Source
:author: Kevin Roy

== Installation

You'll need the following in order to run this script :

* Perl (>=5)
* lib::local
* cpanm

== Usage

1. Make this script visible in your PATH environment.

2. Create some directory and run the following command inside :

    $ fusioninventory_source_install.sh <git_revision>

3. Once everything is installed, you'll find a directory called
   +fusioninventory-agent_<git_revision>+ and you can finally run :

    $ make install

== Configuration

By default, fusioninventory will build and install inside the
fusioninventory-agent_<git_revision>.

You can change +$prefix+ and +$sysconfdir+ variable in
+install_env.sh+ in order to specify another PREFIX installation and
set a custom configuration path for your +agent.cfg+.
